<p>"Exercise 1. Instructions
    Store your favorite food into a variable.
    Store your favorite meal of the day into a variable (ie. breakfast, lunch or dinner)
    Console.log I eat <favorite food> at every <favorite meal>"</p>

    <p>"Exercise 2. Instructions

        Part I
        Using this array : const myWatchedSeries = ["black mirror", "money heist", "the big bang theory"];
        Create a variable named myWatchedSeriesLength that is equal to the number of series in the myWatchedSeries array.
        Create a variable named myWatchedSeriesSentence, that is equal to a sentence describing the series you watched
        For example : black mirror, money heist, and the big bang theory
        Console.log a sentence using both of the variables created above
        For example : I watched 3 series : black mirror, money heist, and the big bang theory

        Part II
        Change the series “the big bang theory” to “friends”. 
        Hint :  You will need to use the index of “the big bang theory” series.
        Add, at the end of the array, the name of another series you watched.
        Add, at the beginning of the array, the name of your favorite series.
        Delete the series “black mirror”.
        Console.log the third letter of the series “money heist”.
        Finally, console.log the myWatchedSeries array, to see all the modifications you’ve made.</p>

        <p>Exercise 3. Instructions
            The Temperature Converter
            Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
            Convert it to fahrenheit and console.log <temperature>°C is <temperature>°F.
            Hint : Should you create another variable to hold the temperature in fahrenheit? (ie. point 2)
            Hint: To convert a temperature from celsius to fahrenheit : Divide it by 5, then multiply it by 9, then add 32</p>

            <p>Exercise 4. Instructions
                Guess The Answers #1
                For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command. 
                Of course, explain each prediction.
                Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.
            </p>
