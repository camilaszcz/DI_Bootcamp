    ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Work With Forms
    
    Instructions
    
    Copy the code below, into a structured HTML file:
    
    <form>
      <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
      <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
      <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
      <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" id="submit">
    </form> 
    <ul class="usersAnswer"></ul>
    
    
    Retrieve the form and console.log it.
    
    Retrieve the inputs by their id and console.log them.
    
    Retrieve the inputs by their name attribute and console.log them.
    
    When the user submits the form (ie. submit event listener)
    use event.preventDefault(), why ?
    get the values of the input tags,
    make sure that they are not empty,
    create an li per input value,
    then append them to a the <ul class="usersAnswer"></ul>, below the form.
    The output should be :
    
    <ul class="usersAnswer">
        <li>first name of the user</li>
        <li>last name of the user</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3 : Transform The Sentence
    
    Instructions
    
    Add this sentence to your HTML file then follow the steps :
    
    <p><strong>Hello</strong> I hope you are enjoying <strong>this</strong> class. At the
    <strong>end</strong> you <strong>will</strong> be great Developers!
    <strong>Enjoy</strong> the <strong>JavaScript </strong> lessons</p>
    
    
    In the JS file:
    
    Declare a global variable named allBoldItems.
    
    Create a function called getBold_items() that takes no parameter. This function should collect all the bold items inside the paragraph and assign them to the allBoldItems variable.
    
    Create a function called highlight() that changes the color of all the bold text to blue. 
    
    Create a function called return_normal() that changes the color of all the bold text back to black. 
    
    Call the function highlight() on mouseover (ie. when the mouse pointer is moved onto the paragraph), and the function return_normal() on mouseout (ie. when the mouse pointer is moved out of the paragraph). Look at this example

        </head> 
        <body> 
            <p>Input radius value and get the volume of a sphere.</p> 
            <form  id="MyForm"> 
                <label for="radius">Radius</label><input type="text" name="radius" id="radius" required> 
                <label for="volume">Volume</label><input type="text" name="volume" id="volume"> 
                <input type="submit" value="Calculate" id="submit">
