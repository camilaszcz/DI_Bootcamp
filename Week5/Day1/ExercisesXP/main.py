# # üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs

# # Instructions

# # Create a class called Dog.
# # In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters
        
# # class Dog():
# #     def __init__(self, name, height):
# #         self.name = name
# #         self.height = height
        

# # Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
# # using and accessing global class attributes

    
# class Dog():
#     bark = 'goes woof!'  # global attribute, accessible through the class itself

#     def __init__(self, name, height):
#         self.name = name
#         self.height = height
        
        
# print((Dog('Sam', 50)).name, Dog.bark)


# # Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.

# # Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
# # Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# # Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
# # Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# # Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

# Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs The Song Producer?

# Instructions

# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.

# class Song(object):
#     def __init__(self, lyrics):
#         self.lyrics=lyrics
    
#     def sing_me_a_song(self):

#             print (line)

# stairway = Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])


# print (stairway.sing_me_a_song())


# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo

# Instructions









# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).

# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
